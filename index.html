      <h4 class="intro">Casandra McDonald is a Senior UX / UI Designer, Front-End Web Developer, and Certified Scrum Master with over 10+ years of experience based in New York City. My goal is to help business grow by designing and developing web and native applications. I currently run my own <i class="special">consulting business</i> as a designer and developer for clients based in NYC, specializing in the finance and e-commerce industries.</h4>
      <p class="about">
        As a <strong>UX designer</strong>, I believe in user-centric design, and enforce those principles even throughout the design process. I follow the double diamond framework when starting any UX project: <strong>Discover, Design, Develop, Deliver.</strong> I work with companies on business strategy, perform competitive analysis, conduct user interviews, contextual inquiries, and usability testing. I also develop user personas, user flows, and feature prioritization with MVP focus. I possess a keen understanding of market dynamics that impact the successful launch of applications.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a <strong>UI designer</strong>, I follow all up to date HCI and W3C guidelines for accessibly on desktop and mobile applications. I would describe my work as clean, beautiful, and asthetically pleasing. I conform to a <i class="special">"less is more"</i> methodology and apply that approach to reduce cognitive friction throughout all of my design deliverables. I create sketches and low, mid, and high fidelity mockups using Adobe XD and am well-versed in creating extremely detailed interactive prototypes with custom animations using XD and Principle. I frequently work with development teams to ensure pixel perfect asset delivery and create follow up documentation and style guides.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a <strong>web developer</strong>, my goal is to write clean, semantic, accessible code. I work with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery and PHP. I have hand coded over 200+ responsive websites and have experience building apps and APIs with the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I am currently in school at General Assembly until summer 2020 to expand my existing skillset in the Full Stack Development realm.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a <strong>product manager</strong>, I am experienced at working on projects and leading teams to success at all stages from gathering requirements to deploying web and native mobile applications in Agile to enterprise level. I am expert in integrating Front-end, UI/UX capabilities and technical requirements into a cohesive strategy to final product delivery. I excel at collaborating in a cross-functional environment and building consensus through influence as a recognized subject matter expert in finance and data driven projects. </p>
